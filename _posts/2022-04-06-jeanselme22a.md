title: 'Neural Survival Clustering: Non-parametric mixture of neural networks for
  survival clustering'
abstract: Survival analysis involves the modelling of the times to event. Proposed
  neural network approaches maximise the predictive performance of traditional survival
  models at the cost of their interpretability. This impairs their applicability in
  high stake domains such as medicine. Providing insights into the survival distributions
  would tackle this issue and advance the medical understanding of diseases. This
  paper approaches survival analysis as a mixture of neural baselines whereby different
  baseline cumulative hazard functions are modelled using positive and monotone neural
  networks. The efficiency of the solution is demonstrated on three datasets while
  enabling the discovery of new survival phenotypes.
