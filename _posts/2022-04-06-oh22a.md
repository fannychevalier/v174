title: Lead-agnostic Self-supervised Learning for Local and Global Representations
  of Electrocardiogram
abstract: In recent years, self-supervised learning methods have shown significant
  improvement for pre-training with unlabeled data and have proven helpful for electrocardiogram
  signals. However, most previous pre-training methods for electrocardiogram focused
  on capturing only global contextual representations. This inhibits the models from
  learning fruitful representation of electrocardiogram, which results in poor performance
  on downstream tasks. Additionally, they cannot fine-tune the model with an arbitrary
  set of electrocardiogram leads unless the models were pre-trained on the same set
  of leads. In this work, we propose an ECG pre-training method that learns both local
  and global contextual representations for better generalizability and performance
  on downstream tasks. In addition, we propose random lead masking as an ECG-specific
  augmentation method to make our proposed model robust to an arbitrary set of leads.
  Experimental results on two downstream tasks, cardiac arrhythmia classification
  and patient identification, show that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art
  methods.
