title: Identification of Subgroups With Similar Benefits in Off-Policy Policy Evaluation
abstract: Off-policy policy evaluation methods for sequential decision making can
  be used to help identify if a proposed decision policy is better than a current
  baseline policy. However, a new decision policy may be better than a baseline policy
  for some individuals but not others. This has motivated a push towards personalization
  and accurate per-state estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Given
  the limited data present in many important applications such as health care, individual
  predictions can come at a cost to accuracy and confidence in such predictions.  We
  develop a method to balance the need for personalization with confident predictions
  by identifying subgroups where it is possible to confidently estimate the expected
  difference in a new decision policy relative to a baseline. We propose a novel loss
  function that accounts for the uncertainty during the subgroup partitioning phase.
  In experiments, we show that our method can be used to form accurate predictions
  of HTEs where other methods struggle.
