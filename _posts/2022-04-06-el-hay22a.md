title: Estimating Model Performance on External Samples from Their Limited Statistical
  Characteristics
abstract: Methods that address data shifts usually assume full access to multiple
  datasets. In the healthcare domain, however, privacy-preserving regulations as well
  as  commercial interests limit data availability and, as a result, researchers can
  typically study only a small number of datasets. In contrast, limited statistical
  characteristics of specific patient samples are much easier to share and may be
  available from previously published literature or focused collaborative efforts.
  Here, we propose a method that estimates model performance in external samples from
  their limited statistical characteristics. We search for weights that induce internal
  statistics that are similar to the external ones; and that are closest to uniform.
  We then use model performance on the weighted internal sample as an estimation for
  the external counterpart. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on simulated data as
  well as electronic medical record data for two risk models, predicting complications
  in ulcerative colitis patients and stroke in women diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.
  In the vast majority of cases, the estimated external performance is much closer
  to the actual one than the internal performance. Our proposed method may be an important
  building block in training robust models and detecting potential model failures
  in external environments.
