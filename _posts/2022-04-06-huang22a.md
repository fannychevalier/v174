title: Enriching Unsupervised User Embedding via Medical Concepts
abstract: Clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHR) present rich documented
  information of patients to inference phenotype for disease diagnosis and study patient
  characteristics for cohort selection. Unsupervised user embedding aims to encode
  patients into fixed-length vectors without human supervisions. Medical concepts
  extracted from the clinical notes contain rich connections between patients and
  their clinical categories. However, existing \textit{unsupervised} approaches of
  user embeddings from clinical notes do not explicitly incorporate medical concepts.
  In this study, we propose a concept-aware unsupervised user embedding that jointly
  leverages text documents and medical concepts from two clinical corpora, MIMIC-III
  and Diabetes. We evaluate user embeddings on both extrinsic and intrinsic tasks,
  including phenotype classification, in-hospital mortality prediction, patient retrieval,
  and patient relatedness. Experiments on the two clinical corpora show our approach
  exceeds unsupervised baselines, and incorporating medical concepts can significantly
  improve the baseline performance.
