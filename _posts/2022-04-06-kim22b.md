title: Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction of Clinical Text via Conditional Independence
abstract: Spelling correction is a particularly important problem in clinical natural
  language processing because of the abundant occurrence of misspellings in medical
  records. However, the scarcity of labeled datasets in a clinical context makes it
  hard to build a machine learning system for such clinical spelling correction. In
  this work, we present a probabilistic model of correcting misspellings based on
  a simple conditional independence assumption, which leads to a modular decomposition
  into a language model and a corruption model. With a deep character-level language
  model trained on a large clinical corpus, and a simple edit-based corruption model,
  we can build a spelling correction model with small or no real data. Experimental
  results show that our model significantly outperforms baselines on two healthcare
  spelling correction datasets.
