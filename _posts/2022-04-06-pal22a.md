title: 'MedMCQA: A Large-scale Multi-Subject Multi-Choice Dataset for Medical domain
  Question Answering'
abstract: This paper introduces MedMCQA, a new large-scale, Multiple-Choice Question
  Answering (MCQA) dataset designed to address real-world medical entrance exam questions.
  More than 194k high-quality AIIMS & NEET PG entrance exam MCQs covering 2.4k healthcare
  topics and 21 medical subjects are collected with an average token length of 12.77
  and high topical diversity. Each sample contains a question, correct answer(s),
  and other options which requires a deeper language understanding as it tests the
  10+ reasoning abilities of a model across a wide range of medical subjects & topics.
  A detailed explanation of the solution, along with the above information, is provided
  in this study.
