title: 'ADCB: An Alzheimer’s disease simulator for benchmarking observational estimators
  of causal effects'
abstract: Simulators make unique benchmarks for causal effect estimation as they do
  not rely on unverifiable assumptions or the ability to intervene on real-world systems.
  This is especially important for estimators targeting healthcare applications as
  possibilities for experimentation are limited with good reason. We develop a simulator
  of clinical variables associated with Alzheimer’s disease, aimed to serve as a benchmark
  for causal effect estimation while modeling intricacies of healthcare data. We fit
  the system to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and
  ground hand-crafted components in results from comparative treatment trials and
  observational treatment patterns. The simulator includes parameters which alter
  the nature and difficulty of the causal inference tasks, such as latent variables,
  effect heterogeneity, length of observed subject history, behavior policy and sample
  size. We use the simulator to compare standard estimators of average and conditional
  treatment effects.
