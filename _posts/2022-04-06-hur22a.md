title: Unifying Heterogeneous Electronic Health Records Systems via Text-Based Code
  Embedding
abstract: Increase in the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has facilitated
  advances in predictive healthcare. However, EHR systems lack a unified code system
  for representing medical concepts. Heterogeneous formats of EHR present a barrier
  for the training and deployment of state-of-the-art deep learning models at scale.
  To overcome this problem, we introduce Description-based Embedding, DescEmb, a code-agnostic
  description-based representation learning framework for predictive modeling on EHR.
  DescEmb takes advantage of the flexibility of neural language models while maintaining
  a neutral approach that can be combined with prior frameworks for task-specific
  representation learning or predictive modeling. We test our modelâ€™s capacity on
  various experiments including prediction tasks, transfer learning and pooled learning.
  DescEmb shows higher performance in overall experiments compared to the code-based
  approach, opening the door to a text-based approach in predictive healthcare research
  that is not constrained by EHR structure nor special domain knowledge.
