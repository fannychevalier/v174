title: Learning Unsupervised Representations for ICU Timeseries
abstract: Medical time series like physiological signals provide a rich source of
  information about patients’ underlying clinical states. Learning such states is
  a challenging problem for ML but has great utility for clinical applications. It
  allows us to identify patients with similar underlying conditions, track disease
  progression over time, and much more. The challenge with medical time series however,
  is the lack of well-defined labels for a given patient’s state for extended periods
  of time. Collecting such labels is expensive and often requires substantial effort.
  In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method, called
  TRACE, that allows us to learn meaningful patient representations from time series
  collected in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We show the utility and generalizability
  of these representations in identifying different downstream clinical conditions
  and also show how the trajectory of representations over time exhibits progression
  toward critical conditions such as cardiopulmonary arrest or circulatory failure.
