title: 'Real-Time Seizure Detection using EEG: A Comprehensive Comparison of Recent
  Approaches under a Realistic Setting'
abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important diagnostic test that physicians
  use to record brain activity and detect seizures by monitoring the signals. There
  have been several attempts to detect seizures and abnormalities in EEG signals with
  modern deep learning models to reduce the clinical burden. However, they cannot
  be fairly compared against each other as they were tested in distinct experimental
  settings. Also, some of them are not trained in real-time seizure detection tasks,
  making it hard for on-device applications. In this work, for the first time, we
  extensively compare multiple state-of-the-art models and signal feature extractors
  in a real-time seizure detection framework suitable for real-world application,
  using various evaluation metrics including a new one we propose to evaluate more
  practical aspects of seizure detection models.
