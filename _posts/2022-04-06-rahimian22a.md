title: Practical Challenges in Differentially-Private Federated Survival Analysis
  of Medical Data
abstract: Survival analysis or time-to-event analysis aims to model and predict the
  time it takes for an event of interest to happen in a population or an individual.
  In the medical context this event might be the time of dying, metastasis, recurrence
  of cancer, etc. Recently, the use of neural networks that are specifically designed
  for survival analysis has become more popular and an attractive alternative to more
  traditional methods. In this paper, we take advantage of the inherent properties
  of neural networks to federate the process of training of these models. This is
  crucial in the medical domain since data is scarce and collaboration of multiple
  health centers is essential to make a conclusive decision about the properties of
  a treatment or a disease. To ensure the privacy of the datasets, it is common to
  utilize differential privacy on top of federated learning. Differential privacy
  acts by introducing random noise to different stages of training, thus making it
  harder for an adversary to extract details about the data. However, in the realistic
  setting of small medical datasets and only a few data centers, this noise makes
  it harder for the models to converge. To address this problem, we propose DPFed-post
  which adds a post-processing stage to the private federated learning scheme. This
  extra step helps to regulate the magnitude of the noisy average parameter update
  and easier convergence of the model. For our experiments, we choose 3 real-world
  datasets in the realistic setting when each health center has only a few hundred
  records, and we show that DPFed-post successfully increases the performance of the
  models by an average of up to $17%$ compared to the standard differentially private
  federated learning scheme.
