title: Semi-Markov Offline Reinforcement Learning for Healthcare
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) tasks are typically framed as Markov Decision
  Processes (MDPs), assuming that decisions are made at fixed time intervals. However,
  many applications of great importance, including healthcare, do not satisfy this
  assumption, yet they are commonly modelled as MDPs after an artificial reshaping
  of the data. In addition, most healthcare (and similar) problems are \emph{offline}
  by nature, allowing for only retrospective studies. To address both challenges,
  we begin by discussing the Semi-MDP (SMDP) framework, which formally handles actions
  of variable timings. We next present a formal way to apply SMDP modifications to
  nearly any given value-based offline RL method. We use this theory to introduce
  three SMDP-based offline RL algorithms, namely, SDQN, SDDQN, and SBCQ. We then experimentally
  demonstrate that only these SMDP-based algorithms learn the optimal policy in variable-time
  environments, whereas their MDP counterparts do not. Finally, we apply our new algorithms
  to a real-world offline dataset pertaining to \emph{warfarin dosing for stroke prevention}
  and demonstrate similar results.
