title: Multi-Task Adversarial Learning for Treatment Effect Estimation in Basket Trials
abstract: Estimating treatment effects from observational data provides insights about
  causality guiding many real-world applications such as different clinical study
  designs, which are the formulations of trials, experiments, and observational studies
  in medical, clinical, and other types of research. In this paper, we describe causal
  inference for application in a novel clinical design called basket trial that tests
  how well a new drug works in patients who have different types of cancer that all
  have the same mutation. We propose a multi-task adversarial learning (MTAL) method,
  which incorporates feature selection multi-task representation learning and adversarial
  learning to estimate potential outcomes across different tumor types for patients
  sharing the same genetic mutation but having different tumor types. In our paper,
  the basket trial is employed as an intuitive example to present this new causal
  inference setting. This new causal inference setting includes, but is not limited
  to basket trials. This setting has the same challenges as the traditional causal
  inference problem, i.e., missing counterfactual outcomes under different subgroups
  and treatment selection bias due to confounders. We present the practical advantages
  of our MTAL method for the analysis of synthetic basket trial data and evaluate
  the proposed estimator on two benchmarks, IHDP and News. The results demonstrate
  the superiority of our MTAL method over the competing state-of-the-art methods.
