title: Uncertainty-Aware Text-to-Program for Question Answering on Structured Electronic
  Health Records
abstract: Question Answering on Electronic Health Records (EHR-QA) has a significant
  impact on the healthcare domain, and it is being actively studied. Previous research
  on structured EHR-QA focuses on converting natural language queries into query language
  such as SQL or SPARQL (NLQ2Query), so the problem scope is limited to pre-defined
  data types by the specific query language. In order to expand the EHR-QA task beyond
  this limitation to handle multi-modal medical data and solve complex inference in
  the future, more primitive systemic language is needed. In this paper, we design
  the program-based model (NLQ2Program) for EHR-QA as the first step towards the future
  direction. We tackle MIMICSPARQL*, the graph-based EHR-QA dataset, via a program-based
  approach in a semi-supervised manner in order to overcome the absence of gold programs.
  Without the gold program, our proposed model shows comparable performance to the
  previous state-of-the-art model, which is an NLQ2Query model (0.9% gain). In addition,
  for a reliable EHR-QA model, we apply the uncertainty decomposition method to measure
  the ambiguity in the input question. We empirically confirmed data uncertainty is
  most indicative of the ambiguity in the input question.
