title: Data Augmentation for Electrocardiograms
abstract: Neural network models have demonstrated impressive performance in predicting
  pathologies and outcomes from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). However, these
  models often need to be trained with large, labelled datasets, which are not available
  for many predictive tasks of interest. In this work, we perform an empirical study
  examining whether training time data augmentation methods can be used to improve
  performance on such data-scarce ECG prediction problems. We investigate how data
  augmentation strategies impact model performance when detecting cardiac abnormalities
  from the ECG. Motivated by our finding that the effectiveness of existing augmentation
  strategies is highly task-dependent, we introduce a new method, \textit{TaskAug},
  which defines a flexible augmentation policy that is optimized on a per-task basis.
  We outline an efficient learning algorithm to do so that leverages recent work in
  nested optimization and implicit differentiation. In experiments, considering three
  datasets and eight predictive tasks, we find that TaskAug is competitive with or
  improves on prior work, and the learned policies shed light on what transformations
  are most effective for different tasks. We distill key insights from our experimental
  evaluation, generating a set of best practices for applying data augmentation to
  ECG prediction problems.
