title: 'PhysioMTL: Personalizing Physiological Patterns using Optimal Transport Multi-Task
  Regression'
abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a practical and noninvasive measure of autonomic
  nervous system activity, which plays an essential role in cardiovascular health.
  However, using HRV to assess physiology status is challenging. Even in clinical
  settings, HRV is sensitive to acute stressors such as physical activity, mental
  stress, hydration, alcohol, and sleep. Wearable devices provide convenient HRV measurements,
  but the irregularity of measurements and uncaptured stressors can bias conventional
  analytical methods. To better interpret HRV measurements for downstream healthcare
  applications, we learn a personalized diurnal rhythm as an accurate physiological
  indicator for each individual. We develop Physiological Multitask-Learning (PhysioMTL)
  by harnessing Optimal Transport theory within a Multitask-learning (MTL) framework.
  The proposed method learns an individual-specific predictive model from heterogeneous
  observations, and enables estimation of an optimal transport map that yields a push
  forward operation onto the demographic features for each task. Our model outperforms
  competing MTL methodologies on unobserved predictive tasks for synthetic and two
  real-world datasets. Specifically, our method provides remarkable prediction results
  on unseen held-out subjects given only $20%$ of the subjects in real-world observational
  studies. Furthermore, our model enables a counterfactual engine that generates the
  effect of acute stressors and chronic conditions on HRV rhythms.
