title: Disability prediction in multiple sclerosis using performance outcome measures
  and demographic data
abstract: Literature on machine learning for multiple sclerosis has primarily focused
  on the use of neuroimaging data such as magnetic resonance imaging and clinical
  laboratory tests for disease identification. However, studies have shown that these
  modalities are not consistent with disease activity such as symptoms or disease
  progression. Furthermore, the cost of collecting data from these modalities is high,
  leading to scarce evaluations. In this work, we used multi-dimensional, affordable,
  physical and smartphone-based performance outcome measures (POM) in conjunction
  with demographic data to predict multiple sclerosis disease progression. We performed
  a rigorous benchmarking exercise on two datasets and present results across 13 clinically
  actionable prediction endpoints and 6 machine learning models. To the best of our
  knowledge, our results are the first to show that it is possible to predict disease
  progression using POMs and demographic data in the context of both clinical trials
  and smartphone-based studies by using two datasets. Moreover, we investigate our
  models to understand the impact of different POMs and demographics on model performance
  through feature ablation studies. We also show that model performance is similar
  across different demographic subgroups (based on age and sex). To enable this work,
  we developed an end-to-end reusable pre-processing and machine learning framework
  which allows quicker experimentation over disparate MS datasets.
